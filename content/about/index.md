Hi, my name is Elliot Goode, I'm a software engineer & designer, 
"full stack developer" (if you like buzz words), based out of Cheltenham, England.

With over 20 year experience & an extensive knowledge of fundamental HTML, CSS & Javascript along side various ever changing frameworks, libraries & languages such as Laravel, Tailwind, Vue. 

Typically I would describe my work as clean, understated & timeless with strong focus on detail & consistency.

I build web applications for a wide range of clients & audiences, comfortable working with Cloud vendors such as AWS. I cut my teath as a IT technician, equally at home working in a physical data centre directly on the tin or in the cloud.
