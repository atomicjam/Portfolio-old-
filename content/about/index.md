Hi, my name is Elliot Goode, I'm a software engineer based out of Cheltenham, England.

Typically I would describe my work as clean, understated & timeless with strong focus on detail & consistency.

With over 20 year experience & an extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS & Javascript alongside ever changing frameworks, libraries & languages such as Laravel, Tailwind, Vue. 

I build web applications for a wide range of audiences, comfortable working with Cloud vendors such as AWS. I cut my teath as a IT technician, equally at home working in a physical data centre directly on the tin or in the cloud.
