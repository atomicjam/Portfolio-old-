Hi, my name is Elliot Goode, I'm a software engineer based out of Cheltenham, England.

With 20+ years experience, an extensive knowledge of HTML CSS & Javascript alongside ever changing frameworks, libraries, languages.

Typically I would describe my work as clean, understated with strong focus on detail & consistency.

I build bespoke applications for a range of business needs, comfortable working with Cloud vendors such as AWS. I cut my teath as a IT technician, equally at home working in a physical data centre directly on the tin or in the cloud.
