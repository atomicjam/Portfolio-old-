Hi, my name is Elliot Goode, I'm a software engineer based out of Cheltenham, England. 

I build bespoke applications for a range of business needs, with 20+ years experience, an extensive knowledge of digital technologies.

Typically I would describe my work as clean, understated with strong focus on detail & consistency.  Comfortable working with Cloud vendors such as AWS, or when required on physical tin in a local data centre. 

My history as an Audio visual Engineer and IT technician, gives me a unique insight to all aspects of producing digital media and assets.
